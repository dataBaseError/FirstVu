new guide lines:

Java style file, classes, methods, variables, constants
Classes: start with uppercase and each new word is uppercase, ex: MyClass.cpp
Methods: start with lowercase and each new word is uppercase, ex: myAwesomeMethod
Variables: start with lowercase and each new word is uppercase, ex: myAwesomeVariable
Constant: all uppercase with '_' before each new word, ex: MY_CONSTANT_VALUE
    - note each of these should be slightly descriptive of the actual use/intent of the class, method, variable, or constant.

For declaring methods, constructors, or decontructors:
	- the name must be followed by a bracket no space between them
Ex: myMethod()  // Good
	myMethod () // Bad

Comments:
- use of javadoc
- use /** for start class, and method comments
- use // or /* for in-line comments
    - This is more for doxygen which will pickup /** for method and class comments
- for all comments use a space between the * or the / 
Ex. 
- do not duplicated .cpp and .h comments 
- comments in .h file are for external users (people that do not understand how it is implemented and just wish to use it)
- comments in .cpp files are for internal users (people working on the file and making changes or fixes)
- start files with license
- comment tricky or points of intrest

Formating
- openning curly brace is on the same line (no new line) and ending curly brace is on a new line. Else statment is on a new line (not on the same line as the closing curly brace). Ex:
if (true) {
    //something
}
else {
    //somethingElse
}
- lines need to be 80 characters
    - within reason, ensure that lines that wrap around are spaced accordingly.
    - the line that wraps around should be tabbed in twice.
Ex:
reallyLongMethod(otherReallyLongMethod(), friendOfReallyLongMethod(), 3, 4,
        OtherRandomNumbers());
- if conditions that are to large to fit in one line will break up along && or ||s
- For if, while, and for there should a space following and then a bracket
Ex:
	if (true)	// Good
	if(false)	// Bad
- For if, while, and for there should be curly braces even if it is one line

namespaces:
- use 'using namespace std'

Math
	- Spaces between operations

Declare variable at the start of methods
